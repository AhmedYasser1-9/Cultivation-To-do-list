## Project Context
You are building a "Gamified Cultivation Task Manager" web app.
The theme is strictly Xianxia/Wuxia (Martial Arts Fantasy), but **Strictly Halal/Islamic Compliant**.

- Users are "Cultivators".
- Tasks are "Missions" or "Mandates".
- XP is "Cultivation Base" or "Qi".
- Levels are "Realms" (Condensing Pulse -> Houtian... etc).
- Currency is "Spirit Stones".

## Islamic Compliance & Cultural Guidelines (CORE RULE)
**This is the most important rule. Breaking it is a critical error.**
1.  **No Divine Terms:** NEVER use terms like "God", "Deity", "Demi-god", "Divinity", "Ascension to Godhood", or "Omnipotent".
    * *Alternative:* Use "Sage", "Emperor", "Sovereign", "Apex", "Grandmaster", "Immortal" (in the sense of long-lived/Eternal, not divine).
2.  **No Shirk/Polytheism:** The cultivation system is based on **Energy (Qi)**, Discipline, and Breathing exercises. It is **NOT** based on worshiping idols, statues, or ancestors.
3.  **No Haram Mechanics:**
    * **No Gambling:** Mechanics involving luck must not simulate gambling with currency. Random drops are fine (RNG), but betting Spirit Stones is forbidden.
    * **No Intoxicants:** Use "Spirit Tea" or "Medicinal Elixirs". Do not use "Wine" or "Sake".
4.  **Respectful Logic:** Avoid naming features that imply knowledge of the Unseen (Ghayb) or controlling absolute Fate.
    * *Example:* Instead of "Prophecy" or "Foresight", use "Spirit Echo" or "Strategy".

## Tech Stack (Strictly Enforced)
- **Frontend:** React (Vite) + JavaScript.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS.
- **Icons:** Lucide-React.
- **Animation:** Framer Motion.
- **Backend/Persistence:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth).

## Design System & Styling Rules
- **Theme:** Dark Mode ONLY. Use deep backgrounds (`bg-slate-900`, `bg-zinc-950`).
- **Accents:** Use Gold (`text-amber-400`), Jade (`text-emerald-500`), and Crimson (`text-red-500`) for effects.
- **UI Elements:** Cards should look like jade tablets, ancient scrolls, or spirit formations. Use borders with slight opacity.
- **Animations:** Everything must feel smooth. Use Framer Motion for:
    - Task completion (particles/glow).
    - Level up (modal popup).
    - Hover effects on cards.

## Coding Behavior
- Write clean, modern React functional components.
- Always use Tailwind for styling (no CSS files except index.css).
- When logical changes happen (like XP gain), explain it in "Cultivation Terms" in the comments.
- **Naming Convention:** Ensure variable names and UI text adhere to the Islamic Compliance section above.
- Keep components small and modular in `src/components`.

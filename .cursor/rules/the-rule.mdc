## Project Context
You are building a "Gamified Cultivation Task Manager" web app.
The theme is strictly Xianxia/Wuxia (Martial Arts Fantasy).
- Users are "Cultivators".
- Tasks are "Missions" or "Training".
- XP is "Cultivation Base" or "Qi".
- Levels are "Realms" (Mortal -> Foundation -> Golden Core... etc).

## Tech Stack (Strictly Enforced)
- Frontend: React (Vite) + JavaScript.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS.
- Icons: Lucide-React.
- Animation: Framer Motion.
- Data Persistence: LocalStorage (for now).

## Design System & Styling Rules
- **Theme:** Dark Mode ONLY. Use deep backgrounds (`bg-slate-900`, `bg-zinc-950`).
- **Accents:** Use Gold (`text-amber-400`), Jade (`text-emerald-500`), and Crimson (`text-red-500`) for effects.
- **UI Elements:** Cards should look like jade tablets or ancient scrolls. Use borders with slight opacity.
- **Animations:** Everything must feel smooth. Use Framer Motion for:
  - Task completion (particles/glow).
  - Level up (modal popup).
  - Hover effects on cards.

## Coding Behavior
- Write clean, modern React functional components.
- Always use Tailwind for styling (no CSS files).
- When logical changes happen (like XP gain), explain it in "Cultivation Terms" in the comments.
- Keep components small and modular in `src/components`.
